Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at **Clemson University**, working in the **TigerSec Lab**.  
My research focuses on **3D perception** (point clouds) and the **security of machine learning systems**, particularly in the context of autonomous vehicles.

### üîç Research Interests

My current work includes:

- **Point Cloud Processing**  
  Developing deep learning models for 3D data tasks such as classification, segmentation, and object detection using LiDAR and other spatial sensors.

- **Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Perception Systems**  
  Investigating adversarial vulnerabilities in **RGB-based visual perception systems**, with an emphasis on physical-world attacks that can mislead deep learning models in autonomous vehicles. I also design defense strategies to enhance model robustness in real-world conditions.

- **Security of Autonomous Systems**  
  Bridging the gap between theoretical AI threats and real-world risks in safety-critical systems like self-driving cars.

### üìå Current Focus

I am particularly interested in advancing the **robustness and reliability** of visual perception systems in autonomous platforms. My work includes evaluating the impact of physical adversarial attacks and developing practical defenses to ensure safe deployment under diverse and challenging environmental conditions.
