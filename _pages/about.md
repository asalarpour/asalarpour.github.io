### üîç Research Interests

My current work includes:

- **Point Cloud Processing**  
  Developing deep learning methods for 3D data tasks such as classification, segmentation, and object detection using LiDAR and other spatial sensors.

- **Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Perception Systems**  
  Exploring adversarial vulnerabilities in **RGB-based visual perception systems**, with a focus on how physical-world attacks can deceive deep learning models used in autonomous vehicles. I also work on designing robust defense mechanisms to improve model resilience in real-world conditions.

- **Autonomous Systems Security**  
  Bridging the gap between theoretical AI threats and practical risks in safety-critical systems like self-driving cars.
