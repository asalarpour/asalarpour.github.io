## Teaching philosophy

My teaching focuses on three principles:

- **Cohesion:** I organize content as a connected roadmap, so students can see how concepts fit together.
- **Applied learning:** I pair fundamentals with realistic examples and assignments that require transfer to new settings.
- **Engagement:** I actively invite questions and create an environment where students feel comfortable participating.

## Teaching interests

I enjoy teaching topics at the intersection of:

- Machine learning and deep learning
- Computer vision and 3D perception
- Security and robustness of ML systems
- Autonomous systems and safety-critical computing
