We present a framework for black-box adversarial attacks on traffic signs using **temporally coherent shadows**. Unlike single-frame attacks, our method operates across sequences, simulating realistic AV camera observations.

We design a **non-differentiable shadow generator** whose scale evolves over time and use a **genetic algorithm** to optimize geometry and opacity. Our dual-loss objective maximizes classification error and attention disruption, measured via DINO ViT attention maps.

On GTSRB, our method achieves up to **87.5% SL-ASR**, and **attention supervision** improves effectiveness by 11â€“18%.
