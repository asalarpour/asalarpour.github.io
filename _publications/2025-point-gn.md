This paper proposes **Point-GN**, a novel non-parametric network that uses Gaussian Positional Encoding to enable accurate and efficient 3D point cloud classification. By avoiding trainable parameters and relying on geometric operations like FPS and k-NN, Point-GN delivers competitive accuracy while being highly efficient and scalableâ€”ideal for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
