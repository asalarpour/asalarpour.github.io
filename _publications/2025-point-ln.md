We introduce **Point-LN**, a novel lightweight framework designed for efficient 3D point cloud classification. The architecture combines non-parametric building blocks such as **Farthest Point Sampling (FPS)**, **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**, and **non-learnable positional encoding** with a minimalist learnable classifier.

Point-LN delivers high classification accuracy while significantly reducing parameter count and computation time, making it well suited for **real-time and resource-constrained environments**. Evaluations on benchmark datasets including **ModelNet40** and **ScanObjectNN** show that Point-LN performs competitively with state-of-the-art methodsâ€”while being much more efficient.

These results demonstrate Point-LNâ€™s potential for scalable and deployable point cloud understanding in practical computer vision applications.
