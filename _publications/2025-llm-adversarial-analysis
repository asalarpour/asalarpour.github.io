This work-in-progress explores how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to bridge the gap between adversarial **detection** and **explanation** in autonomous vehicle security systems. Rather than stopping at identifying that an anomaly occurred, our approach uses LLMs to interpret and describe the **context, intent, and potential impact** of adversarial scenarios.

We present early findings from applying LLM-based reasoning to detected adversarial patterns in vision models, including:
- Scenario classification
- Threat-level estimation
- Descriptive summaries for human operators

This initial study indicates LLMs could enhance AV security systems by **generating interpretable responses** to adversarial behavior—potentially enabling faster, more informed human oversight.
