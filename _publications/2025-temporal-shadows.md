We present a framework for black-box adversarial attacks on traffic signs using **temporally coherent shadows**. Unlike previous methods that target isolated frames, our approach attacks entire traffic sign **sequences**, mimicking real-world autonomous vehicle (AV) observation behavior.

Our method uses a **non-differentiable shadow generator** with fixed geometry and opacity, whose spatial scale evolves over time. A **genetic algorithm** is employed to optimize shadow parameters under a dual-loss objective that maximizes both classification error and attention disruption, using DINO ViT attention maps.

Evaluated on GTSRB, our method achieves a **sequence-level attack success rate (SL-ASR)** of up to **87.5%**, and **attention supervision** improves attack effectiveness by **11â€“18%** compared to baseline strategies.
